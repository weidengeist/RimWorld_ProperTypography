# »RimWorld« Typography Mod

This project modifies the layout of various text elements in the game – especially physical units, but also percentage symbols, multiplication and minus signs, and enumerations – so that they obey the common typographical rules. The modified elements are adjustable to your liking via an XML file in the language folder of this mod.
